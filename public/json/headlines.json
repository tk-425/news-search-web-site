Jade says she is “all the way on the fence” when it comes to deciding whether to remain in Los Angeles or return to Washington, D.C. Elliott is also not sure what he wants to do yet.</p> <p>Jade says one thing she does like about being in Los Angeles is that she has her family around her. She has depression, so it helps to have people she knows and loves close by. Jade says she would probably cry if she went back to Washington, D.C. and Greg and Elliott decided to stay in Los Angeles.</p> <p>“Living with depression can be heavy in general,” says Jade. “Greg and Elliott have really been a rock in my life. They’re a huge support system during those sad and difficult times.”</p> <p>Jade later says she can see herself spending time in both Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. She still needs time to see where her career takes her.</p> <h2>Greg Jr. and Elliott take a big step in their relationship</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/judge-mathis-son-was-angry-his-boyfriend-had-to-cook-while-family-enjoyed-camping-trip.html/\">Greg and Elliott</a> moved from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles as a trial to see if they wanted to stay. Greg decided he would like to live and work in Los Angeles, but Elliott isn’t convinced. However, he did agree to the trial period.</p> <p>Elliott later decides he does want to say in Los Angeles. He gets down on one knee during a family celebration and asks Greg if he will move to Los Angeles with him.</p> <p>Greg’s family was taken off guard because they thought it was a marriage proposal. Amir joked that when Elliott really does propose he won’t care.</p> <h2>Amir makes a big announcement</h2> <p>Amir stopped by his parent’s house and told them he saw a shaman. He explained that he’s <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/judge-mathis-concerned-about-sons-behavior.html/\">working on his personal development</a>. Amir also let his parents know that he filed his divorce papers.</p> <p>Amir says he felt emotional when filing his paperwork. His marriage is over, but he hasn’t given up on finding love. He describes feeling like a weight was lifted from him after filing his divorce papers.</p> <p>“I felt like the pressure of the world was on [me and my ex-wife] to succeed,” he says. “But it felt like weight was lifted off of me.”</p> <p>Judge Mathis advises his son to find a woman like his mother. “You need a woman like your mother because ultimately it will pay off for everybody,” he says.</p> <h2>Judge Mathis prepares for the Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony</h2> <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> <div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Judge Mathis' Granddaughter DISINTERESTED in His Walk of Fame News | Mathis Family Matters | E!\" width=\"925\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hvE1WvWFwk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div> </div></figure> <p>Judge Mathis prepares for his <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/taraji-p-henson-gets-a-star-on-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame.html/\">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> ceremony. He reflects on his career and how far he has come. He says his success is only possible because of the support of his family. Mathis says his wife, Linda, was very understanding when he had to work long hours.</p> <p>“The star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is certainly my highest professional achievement,” says Mathis during his reality show. “But it was really my family that was the foundation of my success. After coming out of the streets in Detroit, Linda allowed me to work 15 hours a day, five, six days a week. So, it’s that support that allowed me to pursue the success that you see.”</p> <p>Follow Sheiresa Ngo on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SheiresaNgo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/judge-mathis-son-starts-podcast-wife-faces-fear-of-public-speaking.html/\">Judge Mathis’ Son Starts a Podcast and His Wife Faces Her Fear of Public Speaking</a></p>","pubDate":"2022-08-13 21:15:48","image_url":null,"source_id":"cheatsheet","country":["united states of america"],"category":["entertainment"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Glen Mason's vision fundamentally changed look of Gophers football 25 years later","link":"https://www.startribune.com/glen-masons-vision-fundamentally-changed-look-of-gophers-football-25-years-later/600198115/","keywords":null,"creator":["Chip Scoggins"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-08-13 21:13:14","image_url":null,"source_id":"startribune","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Ukraine destroys Russian supply bridges, one-fifth of ground forces","link":"https://nypost.com/2022/08/13/ukraine-destroys-russian-supply-bridges-20-of-ground-forces/","keywords":null,"creator":["Isabel Vincent"],"video_url":null,"description":"Both spans have been used by Russian forces in the occupied city of Kherson on the Black Sea to transport soldiers and war materiel.","content":"Both spans have been used by Russian forces in the occupied city of Kherson on the Black Sea to transport soldiers and war materiel.","pubDate":"2022-08-13 21:12:21","image_url":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/ukraine-blows-up-russian-supply-bridges.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1660410667","source_id":"nypost","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"WSU Cougar collaboration beer coming to Spokane","link":"https://www.kxly.com/wsu-cougar-collaboration-beer-coming-to-spokane/","keywords":["Local News","News","Spokane","Top Stories","Common Language Brewing","flatstick pub","spokane","wsu","wsu cougars"],"creator":["Vincent Saglimbeni"],"video_url":null,"description":"SPOKANE, Wash. — Common Language Brewing Company and Flatstick Pub are joining forces to bring a WSU-themed beer to Spokane.

The two establishments, owned by WSU alums, want your input in picking the name of the new beer! All Cougs fans have to do is donate $5, provide their information and give a name for the Pale Ale. The two companies will then decide which name best suits the beer. Once picked, the winner also gets to WSU’s matchup against the Idaho Vandals on September 3, a signed football from the WSU football team and a release party at the Flatstick Pub location in Spokane. Proceeds from the donations will go to the Cougar Athletic Fund to support WSU student-athletes. You have until 11:59 p.m. on August 17 to submit your beer name. A winner will be announced on August 19. Common Language Brewing Company says to not use any inappropriate or established beer names from other breweries, as well as any WSU trademark verbiage.
