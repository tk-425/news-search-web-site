The director described her as the “meanest person I’ve ever met” after working with her. Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex | Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images Author shares Meghan Markle’s behavior on set made her difficult to work with Tom Bower’s new book Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the War Between the Windsors details the ways Meghan was difficult while filming a series of ads for the Canadian clothing store Reitmans. Bower claims director Jean Malek wrote about Meghan on Facebook. “She is definitely the meanest person I’ve ever met. Just saying,” Malek posted. According to the book (via Newsweek), Meghan wanted changes in the script for a commercial she filmed in 2016 in Montreal. “Seriously, this doesn’t make sense! I’m a brash American and if my name is going to be on something, I’m going to have my say,” Meghan is quoted as saying. “On March 14, the arguments reached their climax,” the author wrote. “After ferocious exchanges a few script changes were made, only to be rejected by Meghan again.” “‘She bulldozed her way through,’ complained one of the team. No one stood up to her,” Bower wrote. “That evening, [film director John] Grammatico emailed [ad agency] Tank’s creative director. Meghan, Grammatico suggested, was not completely wrong. The agency was focusing the commercial on Reitmans’ label and the dress.” Bower continued, “Like all stars, Meghan wanted the focus to be on herself. ‘She needs to be flattered,’ he wrote, ‘and she’s right. Celebrities want to be the hero.’ The solution was to ‘put Meghan in charge because she’s beautiful and famous and she’s in control.’ The script was rewritten by Grammatico.” Meghan reportedly complained about her hotel room Bower also wrote about how Meghan wasn’t satisfied with the size of her hotel room and wished to be registered under an alias. “‘Her identity must be kept secret,’ said her agent, Lori Sale. ‘Meghan doesn’t want to be hassled by the hotel staff, other guests or photographers’,” Bower wrote. “The production team were flummoxed. No one in French-speaking Montreal really knew Meghan.” He added, “In the event, the hotel refused the request. No paparazzi gathered outside the hotel.” Meghan was reportedly ‘always fed up’ on set Bower further shared Meghan’s vibe on set, which led to one assistant calling her “the princess.” The author wrote: “‘The Princess is coming,’ sniggered one assistant as, hard-faced, Meghan arrived on set, avoiding eye contact with the crew.” Bower continued, “‘She was always fed up,’ one crew member noted, ‘sighing, huffing and rolling her eyes at things. It was heavy-going working with her.’ Another claimed that she would be ‘super sweet’ with [her hairdresser] Felix and [make-up artist] Marco and then within seconds turn to the crew and be ‘super-disagreeable.’” Those involved with the filming, according to Bower’s book, didn’t want to challenge Meghan for fear of losing their jobs. “No one dared to contradict Meghan. Keeping their jobs depended on satisfying her demands,” he wrote. “The only consolation was Meghan’s … In front of the lens, she transformed herself into a warm, glamorous icon.” When filming wrapped, Bower’s book shares, Meghan didn’t extend any thanks. “There was none of the customary ‘Thank you’ or ‘See you again’. Meghan departed,” he wrote. “To the surprise of the wardrobe staff, she forgot to leave behind the Aquazzura shoes.” RELATED: Meghan Markle’s ‘Cringe’ Gesture at Event With Prince Harry Exposed Her Insecurity, Body Language Expert Says","pubDate":"2022-07-25 00:10:30","image_url":null,"source_id":"cheatsheet","country":["united states of america"],"category":["entertainment"],"language":"english"},{"title":"David Ortiz highlights Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-ortiz-baseball-hall-of-fame-ceremony/","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Former Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz was inducted into the Hall of Fame as legions of fans cheered him.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 00:08:24","image_url":null,"source_id":"cbsnews","country":["united states of america"],"category":["entertainment"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sunday's Twins-Detroit game recap","link":"https://www.startribune.com/sundays-twins-detroit-game-recap/600192744/","keywords":null,"creator":["Megan Ryan"],"video_url":null,"description":null,"content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 00:08:23","image_url":null,"source_id":"startribune","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Minnesota greats Jim Kaat, Tony Oliva go into the Hall, as does former Twin David Ortiz","link":"https://www.inforum.com/sports/pro/minnesota-greats-jim-kaat-tony-oliva-go-into-the-hall-as-does-former-twin-david-ortiz","keywords":null,"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"In all, 7 are enshrined in Cooperstown.","content":null,"pubDate":"2022-07-25 00:06:22","image_url":null,"source_id":"inforum","country":["united states of america"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Sylvester Stallone Once Vowed to Stop Doing Dramatic Films","link":"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/sylvester-stallone-vowed-stop-dramatic-films.html/","keywords":["Celebrity","Entertainment","Actors","celebrities","Sylvester Stallone"],"creator":["Antonio Stallings"],"video_url":null,"description":"Sylvester Stallone was once against starring in drama movies when he reached a certain age, and thought about quitting that genre of film altogether.","content":"Sylvester Stallone is widely known for his dramatic acting chops as much as he’s known for being an action star. But after so much work put into the industry, he once considered walking away from dramatic roles altogether in his old age. Sylvester Stallone once wanted to show that he could do more than just action movies Sylvester Stallone | Mike Marsland/WireImage Stallone was once on a similar tier that actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger were. Films like Rambo and Rocky solidified the Oscar-nominee as one of Hollywood’s premier action heroes in the 80s. But Stallone didn’t want to just settle for action stardom. The actor wanted to prove that he was capable of a lot more range than others might have thought he had. One of the ways he tried to break away from his action hero stereotype was by starring in the film Cop Land. The 1997 movie was a James Mangold-directed drama about police corruption, and saw Stallone starring alongside veteran actor Robert De Niro. For Stallone, this was an opportunity to show more of his acting ability. “With Cop Land, I was at that point where again the criticism started to bother me, that I was a meat head – this despite Rocky only having six minutes of physicality and the rest just talking,” Stallone once told Empire. “I basically put up my salary to fund the movie because I wanted to prove the point that I wasn’t just a meat head. I wanted to work with really good actors, with all these wonderful actors. It served a purpose.” Sylvester Stallone once shared why he no longer wanted to star in dramatic films Stallone may have wanted to be seen as more of a dramatic actor in the past, but he would later change his mind. After reaching a certain age, Stallone felt there was very little need to continue starring in dramas. At one point, The Expendables star even found the idea of it pathetic. “I’ve done my mind movies and I don’t think people are really too interested in seeing me do that anymore. I think I’m past my prime for doing dramatic films, it’s almost like a pathetic cry out to be recognized as a serious actor,” Stallone once said according to The Guardian. “I did my little moment, I’m very proud of Rocky Balboa and Cop Land but I would much rather just direct dramas than act in them.” But it seemed since then Stallone would have a bit of a change of heart again. The actor would later star in a couple of drama films like Creed, which earned him an Oscar nomination. Sylvester Stallone didn’t set out to be an action star Despite his reputation for being an action hero, Stallone never intended to be a star in the genre. Until the Rambo movies, he asserted that he hadn’t really appeared in too many action movies to begin with. “I never set out to be an action actor, I was an ensemble actor. Rocky was an ensemble piece. Paradise Alley was an ensemble movie,” he once told Bang Showbiz (via Contact Music). “Then along came First Blood and that was the beginning of something unusual. Once all the dialogue was cut out it was a completely visual film.” RELATED: Why Sylvester Stallone Once Felt ‘Trapped’ by His ‘Rocky’ Character","pubDate":"2022-07-25 00:05:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"cheatsheet","country":["united states of america"],"category":["entertainment"],"language":"english"},{"title":"‘The Bachelorette’ 2022 Predictions: Which Bachelorette Will the Men Choose in Week 3?","link":"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-bachelorette-2022-predictions-bachelorette-will-men-choose-week-3.html/","keywords":["Entertainment","TV","The Bachelorette"],"creator":["Erica Scassellati"],"video_url":null,"description":"The men reportedly must choose whether to pursue Rachel or Gabby in week 3 of the 2022 season of 'The Bachelorette.' Here's what we think will happen.","content":"The Bachelorette 2022 has been an unprecedented season. With Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey leading as the show’s Bachelorettes for the entire season, things are bound to get complicated. Several teasers and spoilers have hinted that the men must choose which woman they want to pursue by episode 3. Here’s where we think the men will end up in their decisions. ‘The Bachelorette’ 2022 contestants with Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey | Craig Sjodin/ABC via Getty Images The men reportedly must choose which Bachelorette to pursue in week 3 The 2022 season of The Bachelorette is already getting complicated for Rachel and Gabby. There have been some awkward moments, as the women aren’t sure where most of the men’s intentions lie. There’s reason to believe that by episode 3, the rules of the show will change. Reality Steve recently stated that by night three, the men reportedly must decide which Bachelorette they want to date. He also wrote, “At rose ceremony #3, Rachel and Gabby gave out roses to who they were interested in, and those guys would either choose to accept or not.” The teaser for episode 3 seems to confirm this notion. Bachelor Fantake broke down this teaser, pointing out the moment when Jesse Palmer tells the men, “This whole thing is just not working for them.” The video stated, “This is likely Jesse telling the guys about the change in the show’s format at the upcoming rose ceremony where they’re going to have to pick a lane.” Several men reject Rachel’s roses in favor of Gabby in ‘The Bachelorette’ 2022 So who will the men choose? From teasers, we have a good idea about some of the men’s decisions. First, several teasers have shown James Clarke, aka Meatball, Termayne Harper, and Alec Garza rejecting Rachel’s roses. This clearly means that all three of these men are on the show for Gabby. In The Bachelorette 2022 episode 2, several of the men also made their intentions clear during the group date after the party. Rachel pulled Jason Alabaster aside to talk. However, he told her, “I feel like I should be upfront. To be honest, when I got here, I felt a connection to Gabby.” In episode 2, Logan Palmer made it clear that he wants to explore his connections with both Gabby and Rachel. He received a group date rose from Rachel. However, there’s reason to believe he might declare his intentions for Gabby in week 3. The show’s official trailer shows Logan talking to Gabby, saying, “I still have feelings on the other side.” This could mean that Logan will choose to pursue Gabby, but struggle with lingering emotions for Rachel. Which men will decide to pursue Rachel in week 3? Rachel isn’t the only one who will face rejection in the 2022 season of The Bachelorette. Entertainment Weekly recently released a sneak peek clip from episode 3. In the video, Hayden Markowitz tells Gabby, “I do have my intentions fully for Rachel.” He also refers to Gabby as “rough around the edges.” In the same clip, Jacob Rapini seems to be implying that he is also there for Rachel. “I don’t know if we’ve had the connection that I think I wanted to have,” he tells Gabby. “If you were the only person here, I don’t think I could have the heart to continue.” In the episode 2 cocktail party, Rachel spent time with Tyler Norris. Later, Rachel handed Tyler a rose during the rose ceremony. Tyler told the cameras, “I am all in on Rachel. No question about it. It’s Rachel every day.” Based on pure speculation, we would also guess that Tino Franco sticks around for Rachel since he received her first impression rose.
